# Releasing Strava-Ruby-Client

There're no hard rules about when to release strava-ruby-client. Release bug fixes frequently, features not so frequently and breaking API changes rarely.

### Release

Run tests, check that all tests succeed locally.

```
bundle install
rake
```

Check that the last build succeeded in [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/dblock/strava-ruby-client) for all supported platforms.

Change "Next" in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) to the current date.

```
### 0.2.2 (2015/12/31)
```

Remove the line with "Your contribution here.", since there will be no more contributions to this release.

Commit your changes.

```
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Preparing for release, 0.2.2."
git push origin master
```

Release.

```
$ rake release

### Prepare for the Next Version

```
### 0.2.3 (Next)
